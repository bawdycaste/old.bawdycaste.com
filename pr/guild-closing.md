We are deeply saddened to announce the closure of our longtime home, the Guild Theater in Menlo Park.

Since 2006, we’ve shown up at midnight to put on a silly show that allowed our audiences to not only “dream it” but truly “be it”. The Bawdy Caste wants to thank our amazing theater staff, who have worked tirelessly to support us for over a decade, as well as our devoted audience members who have kept us going all this time.

It is important for us to continue to keep the midnight movie scene alive and thriving in the Bay Area. Know that we are working with Landmark Theatres to find another home on the peninsula for the show that means so much to us all. Follow us on social media to get all the updates!
